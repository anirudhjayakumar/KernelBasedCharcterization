# KernelBasedCharcterization

Performance characterization of HPC applications using application signatures and static code analysis. Application are compared against a known set of kernel signatures after which the characterization is done by comsposig all the kernels that matched. The use of static analysis is for those part of the code that cannot be characterized.
