This is the static analyzer used to arrive at best effort perdiction models for loops and functions. An xml with the
input variables representing the problem size is provided as input and the variabe dependent loops with their file name
and line number are generated as xml output.

To build the code, you will need the ROSE compiler framework and it dependencies. You might also want a specific version
of gcc as prescibed by the ROSE install manuals. 

The makefiles are required to be tweaked to the build environment. The defaults paths are hardcoded to the authors
environment.
